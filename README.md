#  Work Day Scheduler using JQuery & Momentjs

## Project Description

We were tasked with creating a Scheduler that would allow storing user input into the web's local storage, running current/local time, and also unique color styling to different time-blocks. We utilized JQuery, Momentjs, and Bootstrap to make this process straight forward!
